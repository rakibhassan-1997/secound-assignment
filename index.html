            If you’re an architecture firm, your website needs to accomplish
            three things: present your body of work, demonstrate your expertise
            and clearly communicate your ability to address a buyer’s
            challenges. While architects understand good design, their websites
            need to deliver more than aesthetics.

              Every architect knows that first impressions are essential. But
              when it comes to designing their website, first impressions will
              only take a firm so far.The Hinge Research Institute has found
              that 9 out of 10 professional services buyers will rule out a firm
              before ever speaking with them and more than 8 out of 10 will
              check out a firm’s website to evaluate them as a potential
              provider.

              The best architecture firm websites use their brand strategy to
              inform their design choices. Strategic design means using imagery,
              typography, color and layout to tell your story and engage your
              audience in a way that builds credibility and trust.

              Beautiful, vibrant photography plays a critical role on an
              architecture firm’s website. We are visual beings, and gorgeous,
              compelling images convey credibility and stimulate desire for your
              services. While many of the images on your website will illustrate
              your portfolio and showcase your body of work, others may serve a
              purely aesthetic function.

              Project photos are important, but don’t forget the descriptions of
              the projects themselves. Be sure to explain the client’s challenge
              and how you solved it. Try to tell a compelling story. You may
              even want to connect your case stories to the appropriate team
              bios, putting faces and specific expertise to your best work..

              TFrom site architecture and content organization to broken links
              and slow-loading pages, a great user experience is one of the most
              critical elements of any architecture firm’s website. Simply put,
              a website that isn’t user-friendly can frustrate and deter
              potential clients and job candidates.
